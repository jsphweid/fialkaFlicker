# fialkaFlicker

fialkaFlicker is an idea by my good friend, [Gerry Fialka](http://laughtears.com). An experimental flicker film is one where slides of solid colors and interlaced with footage on a frame by frame basis. When the frames are played back at a normal speed (30fps), the result is a flicker. WARNING: do not bother with this app if you have epilepsy!

The app uses Angular2, TypeScript, [P5JS](p5js.org), and other basic web technologies.

The rest of this README will be dedicated to the details of management and advancement of this app.

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.19-3.

## Cool things I'd like to TODO
I'd like to be able to:
 - reorder the order of slides easily
 - change the [color of slides](https://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/)
 - add/subtract slides
 - change the framerate
 - pick any video (from youtube perhaps?)
 - export said video (probably illegal if using youtube?)

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Production Build

Run `ng build --prod --base-href "/fialkaFlicker/" --aot false` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
